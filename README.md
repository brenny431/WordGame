# Word Game

A new flutter project aimed at expanding on the popular "worddle" format of game. We want to step beyond the norm and build a game with more meaning and interaction. 

Planned features:
- Custom dictionaries: Play levels specific to a dictionary type, wether this be crypto related terms or brainrot related items. There will be custom levels for everyone.
- Skips/Hints: Get out of tight spots with the help of a hint or skip the level entirely.
- Custom themes: Customize the app your own way, with planned theme pickers and limited time themes planned.
- New game modes
- Different game types
- Leaderboards and so much more!

Stick around to see how we progress. Game will be available on Google Play by end of December 2025 (We hope)
